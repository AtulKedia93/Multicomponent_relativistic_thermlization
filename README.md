Here you will find a lot of codes and data that look very similar to each other. As a general rule, do not use
codes/data from here that are older than Dec-2019. Those are legacy codes used to make a more current version
which has a similar name. There might be some repetition in newer codes as well, but for all, in general go 
for the most recent version.

The most important files for the thermalization are 

3D : code_e3D_vfv_w_random_w_xsection.m, code_e3D_vfv_w_random.m
     e3D_Rel_FDM_KT01_inject_GeV.m (for high energy injected nuclei)

2D : code_e2D_vfv_w_random_w_xsection.m, 

1D : code_e1D_vfv.m
     e1D_Rel_FDM_KT1_inject_GeV.m (for high energy injected nuclei)

Some of these files typically need a module called "randpdf.m"
